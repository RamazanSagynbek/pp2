!=		Not equal			x != y	
>		Greater than			x > y	
<		Less than			x < y	
>=		Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=		Less than or equal to		x <= y


Operator	Description								Example	
and 		Returns True if both statements are true				x < 5 and  x < 10	
or		Returns True if one of the statements is true				x < 5 or x < 4	
not		Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true			not(x < 5 and x < 10)
